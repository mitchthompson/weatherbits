## A weather and forecast web application that connects to the Open Weather api.

Weatherbits is what you might have guessed, a weather and forecast application. Beyond searching for a single city, users can also register to save a list of favorite cities. Weatherbits was a personal project to push and challenge myself. I was learning a few new technologies that I wanted to use in a project - Bootstrap and jQuery primarily. Many of the skills I learned in this project I've used in my other projects.
